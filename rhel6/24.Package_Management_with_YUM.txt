In RHEL or CentOS we have several ways for configuring a installation repository where we store our packages.
By the use of this repository we can easily install the packages which will be installed along with their depandencies.
We have several ways of configuring a repository. Below are some popular ways explained.

  1. Configure a manual or File mode repository with "createrepo"
    a. Create a directory under /var and copy all your packages(.rpm files) to that directory.
      # mkdir /var/yum && cp -prv /media/<Your_DVD>/Packages/* /var/yum/
    b. Install the "createrepo" package using rpm
      # cd /var/yum
      # rpm -ivh createrepo*
    
    NOTE : If you notice any dependency failure then go ahead and install those packages first.
      | error: Failed dependencies:                                 |
      | deltarpm is needed by createrepo-0.9.8-4.el6.noarch         |
      | python-deltarpm is needed by createrepo-0.9.8-4.el6.noarch  |
    
    c. Now configure the Repository
      # createrepo /var/yum
    d. Create a repo config file which will be looked at when we search for or try to install any packages.
      # cd /etc/yum.repos.d
      # vi local.repo
          [localrepo]
          Name=CentOS local repository
          baseurl=file:///var/ftp/pub/dvd/CentOS/Packages/
          enabled=1
          gpgcheck=0

    e. Now clean the yum database and try to list the details of the repository.
      # yum clean all
          Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, refresh-packagekit, security
          Cleaning repos: localrepo
          Cleaning up Everything
          Cleaning up list of fastest mirrors     

      # yum repolist all  ----> This will list out all our repositories and their status
          Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, refresh-packagekit, security
          Determining fastest mirrors
          localrepo                                                                                                                                   | 2.9 kB     00:00 ...
          localrepo/primary_db                                                                                                                        | 2.8 MB     00:00 ...
          repo id               repo name                         status
          InstallMedia          Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0      disabled
          localrepo             CentOS local repository           enabled: 3,271
          repolist: 3,271 

    f. Now you will be able to install any packages.
    
  2. Configure FTP mode repository.
    a. For configuring a repository which can be used through the FTP mode we need to have configured the below pre-requisites
      i.    IP configured for the machine we are using.
      ii.   VSFTPD service installed
    b. Create a directory at "/var/ftp/pub" and copy all the contents of your DVD to that directory.
      # mkdir -p /var/ftp/pub/dvd && cp -prv /media/<CentOS/RHEL_DVD>/* /var/ftp/pub/dvd/
    c. Create a repo config file as below
      # cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
      # vi ftp.repo
          [ftprepo]
          Name=CentOS FTP repository
          baseurl=ftp://192.168.1.120/pub/dvd/CentOS/Packages/
          enabled=1
          gpgcheck=0
    d. Clean the yum database and query for the newly configured yum repository
      # yum clean all
          Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, refresh-packagekit, security
          Cleaning repos: ftprepo
          Cleaning up Everything
          Cleaning up list of fastest mirrors

      # yum repolist all
          Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, refresh-packagekit, security
          Determining fastest mirrors
          ftprepo                                                                                                                                     | 2.9 kB     00:00 ...
          ftprepo/primary_db                                                                                                                          | 2.8 MB     00:00 ...
          localrepo                                                                                                                                   | 2.9 kB     00:00 ...
          localrepo/primary_db                                                                                                                        | 2.8 MB     00:00 ...
          repo id             repo name                         status
          InstallMedia        Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0      disabled
          ftprepo             CentOS FTP repository             enabled: 3,271
          localrepo           CentOS local repository           enabled: 3,271
          repolist: 6,542
