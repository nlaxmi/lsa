File and directory permissions:
-------------------------------
For every file or directory we have 3 things to take care about for accessing that.
 1. Permissions
 2. Ownership or Owner of the file
 3. Group who have access to the file

Permissions:
 Every file's or directory's permissions contains 3 octates
  1. Permissions for the Owner
  2. Permissions for the Owner's group
  3. Permissions for other users.
  
 To change the permissions of a file or directory we need to use "chmod" command
 To change the ownership of a file or directory we need to use "chown" command
 To change the owner's group of a file or directory we need to use "chgrp" command
