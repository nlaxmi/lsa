ACL (Access Control Lists) : 

ACL is a utility for managing advanced level permissions on a file or dir
It has two modes

```
 1. To display the permissions of a file or directory 	---> getfacl
 2. To set the permissions of a file or directory 		---> setfacl
	In this mode we have two other modes
	 a. Set or modify permissions	---> (Option -m)
	 b. Remove permissions			---> (Option -x)
```
While we are trying to access a file or Directory the access will be checked in the following order.	 
1. Owner of the File or Directory
2. Group it belongs to
3. Permissions set on it
4. ACL (Access Control List)
5. ACL permissions can be noticed a follows
```
drwxr-xr-x.		<---	No advanced permissions(ACL) are set.
drwxr-xr-x+		<---	+ symbol notifies that ACL applied on it.
```
Task 1 : At first we need to enable ACL on the partition which we need to configure.
	We want to enable ACL for "/" filesystem
```
	Step 1 : 
		# vi /etc/fstab
			Find the entry for the "/" filesystem and add ",acl" after defaults as like below.
		Before : UUID=9dbab158-e9c1-401e-b819-9a26cb5bc82a /                       ext4    defaults        1 1
		After  : UUID=9dbab158-e9c1-401e-b819-9a26cb5bc82a /                       ext4    defaults,acl    1 1
		Save and quit the file.
		
	Step 2 :
		Remount the filesystem for the changes to be effected
		# mount -o remount,rw /
```		
	Now we have done with enabling ACL on "/" filesystem.

Task 2 : Modify or remove perms on Files or directories
	Ensure to have 2 users (Ex. arjun, omkar)
	Created a directory under "/" filesystem (ex. kits)
	Login with omkar and create a text file and provide full permissions.
	Login with arjun and create a directory and provide full permissions.
	
	Requirements : 
	 1. Arjun should not be able to access the file created by omkar.
```
	   a. Know the ACL perms for the file created by omkar
		# getfacl acltest.txt
	   b. Now set the permissions on the file to restrict access to arjun
	    # setfacl -m u:arjun:--- acltest.txt
	   c. Recheck the permissions again
	    # getfacl acltest.txt
		
	 2. Omkar should not be able to access the dir created by arjun.
	   a. Know the ACL perms for the dir created by arjun
		# getfacl acltestdir
	   b. Now set the permissions on the dir to restrict access to omkar
	    # setfacl -m u:omkar:--- acltestdir
	   c. Recheck the permissions again
	    # getfacl acltestdir
		
	 3. Create a group and add arjun, omkar to that group. Provide full permissions for everyone(User, Group, Others). This group should only able to access the file (provide perms through ACL)
	    a. Create group "aclgroup" and add arjun, omkar to it
		 # groupadd aclgroup
		 # usermod -G aclgroup -a arjun
		 # usermod -G aclgroup -a omkar
		b. Provide full permissions for everyone(User, Group, Others)
		 # chmod 666 acltest.txt
		c. Provide permissions for the group to have read and write perms on it.
		 # getfacl acltest.txt
		 # setfacl -m g:aclgroup:rw- acltest.txt
		 Remove the ACL perms set earlier for user arjun
		 # setfacl -x u:arjun acltest.txt
		d. Restrict access for others.
		 # getfacl acltest.txt
		 # setfacl -m o:--- acltest.txt
		 Create a new user (ex. nivas) and try to access the file with user nivas
	 
	 4. Add nivas to aclgroup and restrict access for him.
		a. Add nivas to aclgroup
		 # usermod -G aclgroup nivas
		b. Try to access the file as nivas and ensure that he is able to access
		c. Restrict access for nivas
		 # getfacl acltest.txt
		 # setfacl -m u:nivas:--- acltest.txt
```
